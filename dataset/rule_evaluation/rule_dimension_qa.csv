"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. The attached image shows two engineering drawings of our designed vehicle, one on top of the other. The top drawing shows a close-up view of the design. The bottom drawing (provided for context) shows six smaller views that show all the critical orientations of our design. Note that the close-up view orientation matches one of the six smaller view orientations. Using the close-up view, does our design comply with rule V.1.2 specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the close-up view to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' (complies/does not comply with rule V.1.2), followed by an explanation (started with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,V.1.2a.jpg,direct
