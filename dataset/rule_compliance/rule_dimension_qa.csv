"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows an engineering drawing of the powertrain on the top accompanied by six CAD views of the powertrain on the bottom. The six CAD views each feature a different orientation of our design, so that 3D information about our design can be inferred. The CAD views are provided to contextualize the engineering drawing, which has the same orientation as one of the six CAD views. All units displayed in the engineering have units of mm. The scattershield is made from steel. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.5.2.7a specified in the FSAE rule document? Only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing to answer the question. If a dimension is not explicitly shown, you can assume that it complies with the rules. Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' (complies/does not comply with the rule) followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,T.5.2.7aa.jpg,direct

The scattershield is made from steel. Based on the engineering drawing, does our design comply with rule T.5.2.7a specified in the FSAE rule document? To answer the question, use the scale bar shown at the top of the engineering drawing to compute necessary dimensions in the drawing.
