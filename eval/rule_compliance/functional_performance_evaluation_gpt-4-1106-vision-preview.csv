"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the battery structure. The battery structure is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, can we use the battery structure in the vehicle?  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,1.png,We should use the battery structure in the vehicle because the stress result in the FEA model is less than the yield strength of non-welded 6061-T6 tubing (240 Mpa).,"No.

Explanation: According to rule F.3.5.3b from the provided document, alternative materials may be used for applications shown as permitted in F.3.2.1. However, for the battery structure made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, the rule specifies that the welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for calculations in an SES must be considered in the ""as welded"" condition unless the team provides detailed proof that the frame or component has been properly solution heat treated, artificially aged, and not subject to heating during team manufacturing. The image provided shows the results of an FEA simulation, but it does not provide any evidence of the heat treatment and aging process. Without this proof, the battery structure cannot be assumed to meet the required standards for use in the vehicle."

Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",no,2.png,We should not use the battery structure in the vehicle because the stress result in the FEA model exceeds the yield strength of non-welded 6061-T6 tubing (240 Mpa).,"No

Explanation: Rule F.3.5.3b states that non-welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for calculations in an SES must be: Youngâ€™s Modulus (E) 69 GPa, Yield Strength (Sy) 240 MPa, and Ultimate Strength (Su) 290 MPa. The image provided shows an FEA simulation with a maximum stress value that appears to exceed the yield strength of 240 MPa for aluminum 6061-T6. If the stress in any part of the battery structure exceeds the yield strength, it means that the material will undergo permanent deformation, which is not acceptable for structural components in the vehicle. Therefore, based on the provided FEA results and the specified material properties in the rules, the battery structure would not be suitable for use in the vehicle as it does not comply with the material strength requirements outlined in the rules."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows information about the riders that can be accommodated in the vehicle. At the top of the image, there is general anthropomorphic information. Below that, there is information about the largest man and smallest woman our vehicle can accommodate.

up to 95th percentile male. Based on the data presented, we can see that the data for the largest man and smallest woman that the vehicle can accommodate match the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male anthropomorphic data. Therefore, the vehicle complies with V.2.1.1.","No

Explanation: Rule V.2.1.1 states that the vehicle must be able to accommodate drivers of sizes ranging from 5th percentile female up to 95th percentile male. The image provided shows the dimensions for the smallest woman and the largest man that can be accommodated in the vehicle. According to the anthropometric data, the 5th percentile female has a stature height of 151.3 cm, and the 95th percentile male has a stature height of 188.0 cm. The smallest woman that can be accommodated in the vehicle has a stature height of 154.0 cm, which is above the 5th percentile female height requirement. The largest man that can be accommodated has a stature height of 185.5 cm, which is below the 95th percentile male height requirement. Therefore, the vehicle does not comply with the rule as it does not accommodate the full range of driver sizes specified."

Explanation: Rule V.2.1.1 states that the vehicle must be able to accommodate drivers of sizes ranging from 5th percentile female up to 95th percentile male. The image provided shows the dimensions for the smallest woman and the largest man that can be accommodated in the vehicle. The dimensions for the smallest woman are within the 5th percentile female range, and the dimensions for the largest man are within the 95th percentile male range, indicating that the vehicle can accommodate drivers within the required size range. However, without specific anthropometric data for the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male, it is not possible to conclusively determine compliance with the rule based solely on the image provided. Additional data comparing the vehicle's accommodation capabilities to the standard anthropometric data for the 5th percentile female and 95th percentile male would be required for a definitive answer."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculated values of TS voltage over time. For Tractive System Measuring Points (TSMP), a 10 kOhm resistor could be used to limit the current. Based on this image and rule EV.5.8.4 in the rule document, can we use the resistor for TSMP? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,5.png,"EV.5.8.4a states that accumulator max voltage between 200 and 400 volts requires a 10kOhm resistor. The image shows the max voltage is in the 200 to 400 range, so a 10kOhm resistor will work.","Yes

Explanation: According to rule EV.5.8.4 from the provided document, each Tractive System Measuring Point (TSMP) must be secured with a current limiting resistor. The rule specifies that the resistor must be sized based on the maximum Tractive System voltage, with different resistor values given for different voltage ranges. The image provided shows the calculated Tractive System voltage over time during precharge, which indicates the maximum voltage that the TSMP could be exposed to. Since the rule EV.5.8.4 allows for the use of a resistor to limit the current at the TSMP and does not specify any conditions that would prohibit its use based on the provided graph, a resistor can be used for the TSMP as long as it is appropriately rated for the maximum voltage observed."

The image shows the max voltage is in this 400 to 600 range, so a 15kOhm resistor (and not an 10 kOhm resistor) is needed.","Yes

Explanation: According to rule EV.5.8.4 from the provided document, each Tractive System Measuring Point (TSMP) must be secured with a current limiting resistor. The rule specifies that the resistor must be sized based on the maximum Tractive System voltage, with different resistor values given for different voltage ranges. The image provided shows a calculated Tractive System voltage over time, indicating that the voltage can reach up to 600 V. Based on the rule, for a maximum TS voltage exceeding 400 V DC but not exceeding 600 V DC, a 15 kOhm resistor is required. However, since the rule allows for a resistor with a value of 10 kOhm for voltages up to 400 V DC, and the provided graph shows a voltage that starts from 0 V and eventually reaches 600 V, a 10 kOhm resistor could be used during the initial phase when the voltage is below 400 V DC. But for the entire range up to 600 V, a 15 kOhm resistor would be necessary to comply with the rules. If the system's maximum voltage does not exceed 400 V DC, then a 10 kOhm resistor would be appropriate according to the rules."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the force-displacement curve of the impact attenuator obtained from experiments. Assuming the impact attenuator is a standard honeycomb type, and based on this image and rule F.8.7.2 in the rule document, can we use the impact attenuator in the vehicle? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,7.png,"F.8.7.2 states that the peak load for a standard honeycomb impact attenuator is 60 kN. The force-displacement curve shows that the peak load is less than 60 kN, so this impact attenuator can be used.","No

Explanation: According to rule F.8.7.2 in the rule document, the impact attenuator must be able to withstand a minimum static load of 95 kN distributed over the 200 mm x 100 mm minimum impact attenuator area without permanent deformation beyond 25 mm. The force-displacement curve provided in the image shows that the force exceeds 50,000 N (which is equivalent to 50 kN) at a displacement much less than 25 mm, indicating that the impact attenuator can withstand a significant load without permanent deformation. However, the rule requires a minimum static load capacity of 95 kN, which is almost double the force shown in the curve. Therefore, based on the provided data, the impact attenuator does not meet the minimum static load requirement specified in the rules and cannot be used in the vehicle unless additional data or modifications demonstrate compliance with the 95 kN requirement."

The force-displacement curve shows that the peak load surpasses 62.5 kN, which violates F.8.7.2. Therefore this impact attenuator should not be used.","No

Explanation: According to rule F.8.7.2 in the rule document, the impact attenuator must be tested to ensure that it does not deflect more than 25 mm beyond its position before the test when subjected to the maximum force specified for the type of impact attenuator. The provided force-displacement curve from the experiment shows a continuous increase in force with increasing displacement, but it does not indicate a specific maximum force value or the point at which the 25 mm deflection limit is reached. Without this information, it is not possible to determine if the impact attenuator meets the requirements specified in rule F.8.7.2. Therefore, based on the provided information, the impact attenuator cannot be confirmed for use in the vehicle."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on an assembly of frame tubes. The frame tubes are made from welded steel tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.4.2b in the rule document, should we use the assembly in the vehicle? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",no,9.png,"F.3.4.2b states that the yield strength of welded steel is 180 MPa. The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 250 MPa, which exceeds the yield strength. Therefore this assembly should not be used.","No.

Explanation: Rule F.3.4.2b specifies that welded properties for steel tubing used in the frame must have a minimum yield strength (Sy) of 180 MPa and an ultimate strength (Su) of 300 MPa. The image shows an FEA simulation with stress values represented by a color gradient, with blue indicating areas of low stress and red indicating areas of high stress. The maximum stress shown in the image is 250 MPa, which is above the minimum yield strength but below the ultimate strength specified in the rule. However, without knowing the specific loading conditions, material properties, safety factors, and whether the stress is yield stress or ultimate stress, it is not possible to conclusively determine if the assembly is safe to use. Additionally, the rule requires the material to be able to handle these stresses in bending, buckling, and tension, which cannot be determined from the image alone. Therefore, based on the information provided and the rule cited, the assembly should not be used without further analysis to ensure compliance with all aspects of the rule."

The FEA shows that the maximum stress is 150 MPa, which is less than the yield strength. This assembly can be used.","No

Explanation: Rule F.3.4.2b specifies that welded properties for steel tubing must have a yield strength (Sy) of 180 MPa and an ultimate strength (Su) of 300 MPa. The image shows an FEA simulation with stress values represented by a color scale. The maximum stress value on the scale is 150.00 MPa, which is below the required yield strength. However, without knowing the exact stress values at critical points in the assembly, it is not possible to conclusively determine if the assembly meets the required yield and ultimate strength values. If any part of the assembly experiences stress above 180 MPa, it would not meet the yield strength requirement when considering the welded condition as per the rules. Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm that the assembly is suitable for use in the vehicle without further detailed analysis of the stress distribution."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the calculation of the stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal. Based on rule T.3.2.2 in the rule document, did we use correct inputs in our analysis? Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,11.png,The input force on the brakes is over the 2000 N required in the rules.,"No.

Explanation: Rule T.3.2.2 states that the brake pedal and associated components' design must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without any failure of the brake system, pedal box, chassis mounting, or pedal adjustment. The force input for the analysis shown in the image is 3500 N, which is higher than the minimum requirement specified in the rule. Therefore, the inputs used in the analysis exceed the minimum force requirement, indicating that the team is designing for a higher load than necessary per the rules. However, designing for a higher load can be considered good engineering practice as it adds a factor of safety to the design."

Explanation: Rule T.3.2.2 states that the brake pedal and associated components' design must withstand a minimum force of 2000 N without any failure of the brake system, pedal box, chassis mounting, or pedal adjustment. The image provided shows a calculation of stress on the pedal slats due to a force applied on the pedal, but it does not clearly indicate whether the force used in the analysis is 2000 N or higher. To comply with the rule, the inputs in the analysis must ensure that the pedal can withstand at least 2000 N of force. Additionally, the rule requires the design to withstand this force without failure, which implies that the safety factor and material yield strength should also be considered in the analysis. The image does not provide enough information to determine if these factors were included in the analysis."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image the results from an experiment where the temperature of gearbox components was measured over time. Based on rule T.1.6.1 in the rule document and assuming that the driver may come in contact with the gearbox, can we omit insulation around the gearbox?  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,13.png,"Rule T.1.6.1 states that sufficient heat insulation must be provided to ensure that the driver will not contact any metal or other materials which may become heated to a surface temperature above 60 degrees C. The image shows that the gearbox temperature does not surpass 60 degrees C, so insulation can be omitted.","No

Explanation: According to rule T.1.6.1, sufficient heat insulation must be provided to ensure that the driver will not contact any metal or other materials which may become heated to a surface temperature above 60Â°C. The graph shows that the temperature of the gearbox components, including the housing which the driver may come in contact with, exceeds 30Â°C and is on a rising trend. Although the graph does not explicitly show temperatures reaching 60Â°C, the upward trend suggests that it is possible for the temperature to exceed 60Â°C during longer periods of operation or under different conditions. Therefore, to comply with the rule and ensure driver safety, insulation around the gearbox should not be omitted."

The graph shows that the temperature of the gearbox components, including the housing which the driver may come in contact with, exceeds 60Â°C over time. Therefore, insulation around the gearbox is required to comply with the rule and protect the driver from potential burns."
"We are a student engineering team designing a vehicle for the FSAE competition. Attached is the FSAE rules document. Also attached is an image that shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the mount that connects a motor to the structural frame. The frame is made from non-welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing. Based on the results presented in the image and rule F.3.5.3b in the rule document, should we use the motor mount in the vehicle?  Answer only with a simple 'yes/no' followed by an explanation (begin it with 'Explanation:') that explains the reasoning behind your answer.",yes,15.png,The stress on the frame does not exceed the yield stress of 240 Mpa.,"No

Explanation: According to rule F.3.5.3b from the provided document, welded properties for aluminum alloy 6061-T6 for calculations in an SES must have a Yield Strength (Sy) of 115 MPa and an Ultimate Strength (Su) of 175 MPa. The image shows the results from an FEA simulation performed on the motor mount, which indicates a maximum stress of 121.43 MPa. Since this stress exceeds the specified Yield Strength of 115 MPa for welded aluminum 6061-T6, the motor mount would not be suitable for use in the vehicle as it may not withstand the stresses during operation, potentially leading to failure. It's important to note that the rule specifies ""welded"" properties, and if the motor mount is not welded, the non-welded properties should be considered. However, with the given information and assuming the worst-case scenario (that the mount is welded), it would not be advisable to use this motor mount."

The image shows an FEA simulation result with a maximum stress of 362.13 MPa, which exceeds both the yield strength and ultimate strength values for welded aluminum alloy 6061-T6. Therefore, based on the FEA results and the specified rule, the motor mount would not be suitable for use in the vehicle as it does not meet the strength requirements outlined in the rules."
