Explanation: Rule V.1.2 of the FSAE rule document states that the vehicle must have a minimum wheelbase of 1525 mm. The engineering drawing provided shows a dimension of 3202.4 mm, which is the total length of the vehicle. To determine if the design complies with the wheelbase requirement, we need to measure the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels, which defines the wheelbase. However, the provided drawing does not explicitly show the wheelbase measurement. Without this specific measurement, we cannot conclusively determine compliance with rule V.1.2 based on the provided drawing alone. Additional measurements or information would be required to assess compliance accurately."

Explanation: Rule V.4.1 states that wheels must be 203.2 mm (8.0 inches) or more in diameter. The engineering drawing shows a wheel diameter dimension of R203.2, which indicates a radius of 203.2 mm. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the wheel diameter according to the drawing would be 2 * 203.2 mm = 406.4 mm, which complies with the rule V.4.1. However, without explicit confirmation of the diameter (as the drawing shows radius, not diameter), and based on the standard practice of providing a direct answer based on the provided information, the answer is no, as the diameter is not explicitly shown and we are instructed to only use dimensions explicitly shown in the engineering drawing."

Explanation: Rule V.4.1 states that wheels must be 203.2 mm (8.0 inches) or more in diameter. The engineering drawing shows a wheel diameter dimension of R100.6 mm, which indicates a radius of 100.6 mm. Therefore, the diameter would be 2 x 100.6 mm = 201.2 mm, which is less than the required 203.2 mm. Thus, the design does not comply with rule V.4.1 based on the wheel diameter shown in the engineering drawing."

Explanation: Rule V.4.1 from the FSAE rule document states that wheels must be 203.2 mm (8.0 inches) or more in diameter. Using the scale bar provided in the engineering drawing, which shows a length of 3202.4 mm, it is possible to estimate the diameter of the wheels in the drawing. However, without specific measurements of the wheel diameter from the drawing itself and considering the limitations of estimating dimensions from a scale in an image, it is not possible to conclusively determine compliance with rule V.4.1.

Explanation: Rule V.1.4.2 from the FSAE rule document states that ""The distance to the ground below the Lower Side Impact Structure (F.6.4.5, F.7.5.1) at its lowest point should be 75 mm or less."" Based on the engineering drawing provided, the Lower Side Impact Structure is the lowermost frame element that runs horizontally from the front to the back of the vehicle, located just above the bottom edge of the side pods. Using the scale bar on the engineering drawing, which shows a length of 3202.4 mm, we can visually estimate and compare the distance from the lowest point of the Lower Side Impact Structure to the ground. 

The scale bar indicates that the entire length of the vehicle in the engineering drawing corresponds to 3202.4 mm in reality. By visually comparing the scale bar to the distance from the lowest point of the Lower Side Impact Structure to the ground, it appears that this distance is more than 75 mm, which would mean the design does not comply with the rule. However, without a precise measurement tool or the ability to calculate the exact dimension from the image, this assessment is an estimate and may not be accurate. A precise measurement using appropriate tools on the actual engineering drawing would be required to definitively determine compliance."

Explanation: Rule F.5.7.5 from the FSAE rule document states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located outside of the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 500 mm above the ground. The engineering drawing provided shows the height of the Aerodynamic Device (presumably a rear wing) as 239.48 mm from the reference plane, which is above the top surface of the tires. Since the tires are not touching the ground in the engineering drawing, we cannot directly measure the height of the Aerodynamic Device from the ground. However, given that the tires are typically around 20 inches (or approximately 508 mm) in diameter for a Formula SAE vehicle, and the device is clearly above the half height of the tires, it is reasonable to infer that the Aerodynamic Device exceeds the 500 mm limit above the ground as required by the rule. Therefore, based on the provided engineering drawing and the rule, the design does not comply with rule F.5.7.5."

Explanation: Rule F.5.7.5 from the FSAE rule document states that the Front Hoop must be no more than 250 mm forward of the steering wheel. The engineering drawing shows a dimension of 261.57 mm from the steering wheel to the front-most part of the Front Hoop, which exceeds the maximum allowed distance of 250 mm as per the rule.

Explanation: Rule F.5.7.5 from the FSAE rule document states that the Front Hoop must be no more than 250 mm forward of the steering wheel. The engineering drawing provided shows the Front Hoop and the steering wheel, but without specific measurements for their relative positions, it is not possible to determine compliance with this rule based on the drawing alone. The scale bar provided in the drawing is not sufficient to accurately measure the distance between the Front Hoop and the steering wheel, as it requires an exact scaling reference which is not provided in the image. Therefore, based on the information available in the drawing, it cannot be confirmed that the design complies with rule F.5.7.5."

Explanation: Rule F.5.7.6 from the FSAE rule document states that ""In side view, any part of the Front Hoop above the Upper Side Impact Structure must be inclined less than 20° from the vertical."" The engineering drawing provided shows the inclination of the Front Hoop to be 8.88° from the vertical, which is less than the maximum allowed 20° inclination. Therefore, based on the inclination angle provided in the engineering drawing, the design complies with rule F.5.7.6. However, without specific measurements of the height of the Front Hoop in relation to the Upper Side Impact Structure, it is not possible to confirm complete compliance with the rule based solely on the angle provided. The rule requires that the inclination be measured in relation to the Upper Side Impact Structure, and since the drawing does not provide a direct comparison or the height of the Upper Side Impact Structure, full compliance cannot be determined from the provided information."

Explanation: Rule F.5.9.5 from the FSAE rule document states that the included angle formed by the Main Hoop and the Main Hoop Braces must be 30° or more. In the engineering drawing provided, the angle between the Main Hoop and the Main Hoop Braces appears to be less than 30°, as the braces seem to be more vertical and closer to the Main Hoop than what would be required for a 30° angle. The scale bar indicates that the Main Hoop Braces are not angled sufficiently outward to meet the minimum angle requirement. Therefore, based on the provided drawing, the design does not comply with rule F.5.9.5."

Explanation: Rule F.3.2.1g from the FSAE rule document states that the Main Hoop must be constructed of a single piece of uncut, continuous, closed section steel tubing meeting the requirements specified in F.3.4.1. According to F.3.4.1, for the Main Hoop (Size A), the minimum requirements for steel tubing are an outside diameter of 25.0 mm and a wall thickness of 2.0 mm. The engineering drawing provided shows a dimension for the Main Hoop steel tube with an outside diameter of 25.00 mm, which complies with the outside diameter requirement. However, the drawing does not provide a wall thickness dimension for the Main Hoop steel tube. Without this information, we cannot confirm compliance with the wall thickness requirement of 2.0 mm as per the rules. Therefore, based solely on the provided engineering drawing and the absence of an explicit wall thickness dimension, we cannot conclude that the design complies with rule F.3.2.1g."

Explanation: Rule F.6.4.4b from the FSAE rule document states that the Upper Side Impact Member must be entirely in a zone that is parallel to the ground between 240 mm and 320 mm above the lowest point of the top surface of the Lower Side Impact Member. The engineering drawing shows the dimension from the lowest point of the top surface of the Lower Side Impact Member to the Upper Side Impact Member as 277.15 mm, which falls within the specified range of 240 mm to 320 mm. However, the drawing also shows the dimension from the lowest point of the top surface of the Lower Side Impact Member to the highest point of the Upper Side Impact Member as 309.74 mm, which exceeds the maximum allowed height of 320 mm for the zone.

Explanation: Rule T.5.2.7c from the FSAE rule document states that the scatter shield for chains must have a minimum width equal to three times the width of the chain. The engineering drawing shows the scattershield width as 44.3 mm. However, without the chain width dimension explicitly provided in the engineering drawing, it cannot be determined if the scattershield width is indeed three times the width of the chain.

Explanation: Rule T.5.2.7b from the FSAE rule document states that scatter shields for chains must have a minimum width equal to three times the width of the chain. The chain width is given as 13 mm. Therefore, the required minimum width of the scatter shield should be 3 times 13 mm, which equals 39 mm. 

Using the scale bar provided in the engineering drawing, we can estimate the width of the scatter shield. The scale bar represents 1200.9 mm, and visually comparing the width of the scatter shield to the scale bar, it is evident that the scatter shield is significantly less than 39 mm in width. It appears to be less than one-third of the scale bar's length, which would be less than 400 mm, and since the required width is 39 mm, the scatter shield does not meet the minimum width requirement as per the rule."

Since there is no explicit dimension given for the width of the front and rear tires to establish the connecting line mentioned in the rule, we cannot definitively conclude compliance based on the provided drawing alone. However, the drawing suggests that the front Aerodynamic Device extends beyond the front tire's outer surface, which would imply non-compliance with the rule if the tire width does not compensate for the overhang.

Since the rule requires that the aerodynamic devices be inboard of the vertical planes touching the outside of the front tires, and no dimension is provided for the width of the vehicle without the aerodynamic devices, we cannot conclusively determine compliance based on the provided dimension alone. However, given that the overall width including aerodynamic devices is 1933.1 mm, and considering typical front tire widths and spacing from the centerline, it is likely that the aerodynamic devices extend beyond the vertical planes parallel to the chassis centerline touching the outside of the front tires, which would mean the design does not comply with rule T.7.6.1.

Explanation: Rule T.7.6.3 states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located rearward of the centerline of the rear wheel axles must be in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone. According to T.7.3.3, the Rear Aerodynamic Zone is defined as the volume that is rearward of the Head Restraint Plane, inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centerline. The engineering drawing provided shows a rear wing that extends beyond the rear tires, which suggests that it may not be entirely within the Rear Aerodynamic Zone as defined by the rules. Since the drawing does not provide a direct side view that aligns with the centerline of the rear wheel axles, we cannot conclusively determine the compliance based on the provided dimensions. However, the rule requires that the entire aerodynamic device be within the specified zone, and the drawing suggests that part of the device extends beyond it. Therefore, based on the available information, the design does not comply with rule T.7.6.3."

Explanation: Rule T.7.6.3 states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located rearward of the centerline of the rear wheel axles must be in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone. According to T.7.3.3, the Rear Aerodynamic Zone is defined as the volume that is rearward of the Head Restraint Plane, inboard of two vertical planes parallel to the centerline of the chassis touching the inside of the rear tires at the height of the hub centerline. 

In the provided engineering drawing, the rear wing's endplates appear to extend beyond the vertical planes that would be touching the inside of the rear tires at the hub centerline. This can be inferred by comparing the width of the rear wing's endplates to the width of the rear tires in the drawing, using the scale bar for reference. Since the endplates extend laterally beyond the inside of the rear tires, they do not comply with the rule that requires all parts of Aerodynamic Devices rearward of the rear axle centerline to be within the Rear Aerodynamic Zone."

Explanation: Rule T.7.7.1a from the FSAE rule document states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located outside of the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 500 mm above the ground. The engineering drawing provided shows the height of the vehicle's rear wing endplate as 992.07 mm from the base reference, which is the ground level.

Explanation: Rule T.7.7.1a from the FSAE rule document states that any part of any Aerodynamic Device that is located in the Rear Aerodynamic Zone must be no higher than 1200 mm above the ground. The engineering drawing provided shows the vehicle's side profile with a scale bar, which allows for the measurement of the height of various components of the vehicle.

Using the scale bar provided in the engineering drawing, we can estimate the height of the Aerodynamic Devices relative to the ground. The scale bar indicates a length of 4000.3 mm, which we can use as a reference to measure other dimensions in the drawing. By visually comparing the height of the Aerodynamic Devices (such as the rear wing) to the scale bar, it is apparent that the height of these devices exceeds the 1200 mm limit set by the rules when scaled accordingly.

Therefore, based on the provided engineering drawing and the rule specified, the design does not comply with rule T.7.7.1a."
